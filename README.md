# About Me
## My Interests
- I enjoy soccer, playing video games, interacting with computers, going to the gym, and many more.
## Websites I Recommend
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I recommend _Youtube_ because you can watch pretty much anything on it for entertainment or even educational purposes.
- [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) - _GeoGuessr_ is another great website, it's more of a game and involves placing you in a random country or place where you have to guess based of your surroundings. It is also a great way to practice your geography for fun!
